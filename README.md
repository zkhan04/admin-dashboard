### 2/3/2024:
I finished the project! I think this was actually really fun. CSS is slowly becoming less frustrating. What I learned:
- How to use CSS Grid for making layouts
- How to mix different unit types (px, fr, em) to create responsive layouts
- When to create new CSS classes
- Better use of CSS nesting
- How to use CSS variables to easily make visual changes (I think I overdid it this time though :( )
- When to use Grid vs. Flexbox
- Overall just feel way more confident in my CSS skills.
